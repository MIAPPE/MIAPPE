# MIAPPE v1.1: Request for Comments 2

A revision to the previously published MIAPPE standard has been proposed. It extends [MIAPPE v1.0](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/tree/v1.1-rfc/MIAPPE_Checklist-v1.0) and contains some specific recommendations as to how the MIAPPE principles should be applied to various types of experiments/material. The MIAPPE Checklist Data Model v1.1 document is available as:

- complete PDF and Excel, including all appendixes
	- [MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1.xlsx](MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1.xlsx?raw=true)
	- [MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1.pdf](MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1.pdf)
- text formated for version traceability 
	- [MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1](MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1.tsv)
	- [MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1-Appendix_I-Environment](MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1-Appendix_I-Environment.tsv)
	- [MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1-Appendix_II-Treatment-v1.1](MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1-Appendix_II-Treatment.tsv)

A first set of comments ([MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1-rfc1-CommentsAndAnswers.docx](MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1-rfc1-CommentsAndAnswers.docx?raw=true)) have been integrated during the second quarter of 2018. 
A second request for Comments (rfc2) is now opened for consultation, and we welcome contributions from anyone with interest in the field. 

Feedback can be provided in a number of ways:

- Read the document (as [PDF](MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1.pdf), or in [Excel](MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1.xlsx)), and prepare a review using the following format :
```
 - General comment: MIAPPE v1.1 adresses well the case of ... but could be improved .....
 
 - line #DM-1: Improve description :"" and we need one r more examples
 
 - line #ENV-48 : propose one more recommended environment variable : ....
 
```
- Then send the review 
  - by email to miappe-feedback@ebi.ac.uk 
  - by directly creating an issue on our public [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/issues).  
  - or directly vote or comment existing [issues](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/issues)

All feedback will be traced as Github issues. The reviews will be reorganised and merge when relevant. Feel free to comment the results. 


We would like to encourage feedback by the end of __September 2018__, in order that we can prepare a revised proposal in accordance with the comments (and take further feedback prior to eventual ratification by the MIAPPE steering committee). 

Please share this request with anyone who you know who might be interested in contributing. All contributions will be discussed by the MIAPPE team, and responded to in writing, and contributors will be credited on www.miappe.org.  All contributors will also be invited to participate in the writing of a paper to publicise the next standard version.

Development of MIAPPE is an open process, so if you would like to do more than just comment, and to participate in these meetings, please let us know via miappe-feedback@ebi.ac.uk.
