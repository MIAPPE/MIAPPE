# MIAPPE v1.2: Request for Comments

A revision to the previously published MIAPPE standard is being developed. 

Comments are very welcome:
  - by email to miappe-feedback@ebi.ac.uk 
  - by directly creating an issue on our public [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/issues).  
  - or directly vote or comment existing [issues](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/issues)

All feedback will be traced as Github issues. The reviews will be reorganised and merge when relevant. Feel free to comment the results. 

We would like to encourage feedback by the end of __November 2023__, in order that we can prepare a revised proposal in accordance with the comments (and take further feedback prior to eventual ratification by the MIAPPE steering committee).

Please share this request with anyone who you know who might be interested in contributing. All contributions will be discussed by the MIAPPE team, and responded to in writing, and contributors will be credited on www.miappe.org.  All contributors will also be invited to participate in the writing of a paper to publicise the next standard version.

Development of MIAPPE is an open process, so if you would like to do more than just comment, and to participate in these meetings, please let us know via miappe-feedback@ebi.ac.uk.
