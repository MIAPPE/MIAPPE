A new revision of the MIAPPE standard is proposed with some minor improvements and clarifications. We would like to have your review before publishing it. The details are on the ["v1.2" milestone](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/milestone/5) and summarized below.

Feedback and contributions from anyone with interest in the field are very welcomed using the following:
  - Preferably directly on GitHub by voting or commenting on the issues referenced in the present RFC or on our public [issue tracker](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/issues). See detailed instruction [here](#issues-management). If need be, ie if your remark isn't covered by an existing [issue ](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/issues), feel free to create a new issue.
  - By writing to miappe at elixir-europe.org or one of the steering committee members. We will take care of transferring your feedback into GitHub issues. 

All feedback will be traced as GitHub issues. The reviews will be reorganised and merged when relevant. Feel free to comment on the results. 

We would like to encourage feedback by __30 MAR 2024__. We will prepare afterward a revised proposal in accordance with the comments. Those modifications will be discussed on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/issues).

Please share this request with anyone who you know who might be interested in contributing. All contributions will be discussed by the MIAPPE team, and responded to in writing, and contributors will be credited on www.miappe.org. All contributors will also be invited to participate in the writing of a paper to publicise the next standard version.
