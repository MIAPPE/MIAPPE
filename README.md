MIAPPE
======
Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment
--------------------------------------------------------

MIAPPE is a reporting guideline for plant phenotyping experiments. It comprises a checklist, i.e., a list of attributes that may be necessary to fully describe an experiment so that it is understandable and replicable. It covers description of the following aspects of plant phenotyping experiment: general metadata, experimental design, biosource, environment, treatments, sample management, environmental variables and phenotypes. MIAPPE should be consulted by people recording phenotypic data and arranging for its deposition in public repositories. To read more, please visit http://miappe.org.

In miappe.yaml you can find a structured version of the MIAPPE list. Within each element there is a place for comments and suggestions to improve the guideline. When these are accepted by the MIAPPE steering committee, they will be included in a new MIAPPE version, released in due time.
