# MIAPPE

The Minimal Information About Plant Phenotyping Experiment (MIAPPE) is an open, community driven project to harmonize data from plant phenotyping experiments. MIAPPE comprises both a conceptual data representation and a recommended checklist of metadata required to adequately describe a plant phenotyping experiment. We welcome contributions from anyone interested in plant phenotyping data. It covers description of the following aspects of plant phenotyping experiment: general metadata, experimental design, biosource, environment, treatments, sample management, environmental variables and phenotypes.
