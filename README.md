MIAPPE
======
Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment
--------------------------------------------------------

MIAPPE is a reporting guideline for plant phenotyping experiments. It comprises a checklist, i.e., a list of attributes that may be necessary to fully describe an experiment so that it is understandable and replicable. It covers description of the following aspects of plant phenotyping experiment: general metadata, experimental design, biosource, environment, treatments, sample management, environmental variables and phenotypes. MIAPPE should be consulted by people recording and depositing the data. To read more, please visit http://cropnet.pl/phenotypes.

MIAPPE has been developed in [transPLANT] (http://www.transplantdb.eu/) project, in collaboration with [EPPN] (www.plant-phenotyping-network.eu), and registered with [Biosharing] (https://biosharing.org/bsg-000543). 

In miappe.yaml you can find a structured version of the MIAPPE list. For a simple tabular visualisation of MIAPPE as html (with selected information only) see here:
