# MIAPPE v1.1: Request for Comments

A revision to the previously published MIAPPE standard has been proposed. It extends [MIAPPE v1.0](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE-checklist) and contains some specific recommendations as to how the MIAPPE principles should be applied to various types of experiments/material. The MIAPPE checklist document is available as:

- complete PDF, including all appendixes
	- [MIAPPE_v1.1](MIAPPE_v1.1.pdf?raw=true)
- text formated for direct editing
	- [MIAPPE_Checklist-v1.1](MIAPPE_Checklist-v1.1.tsv)
	- [MIAPPE_Checklist-Appendix_I-Environment-v1.1](MIAPPE_Checklist-Appendix_I-Environment-v1.1.tsv)
	- [MIAPPE_Checklist-Appendix_II-Treatment-v1.1](MIAPPE_Checklist-Appendix_II-Treatment-v1.1.tsv)

and now open for consultation, and we welcome contributions from anyone with interest in the field. 

Feedback can be provided in a number of ways:

- Comment directly on the proposal in [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1071CknesZEh8xeGyA1gK1HP3LFPaZ5gpsEW0v8KqzPk/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs).  We will try to leave comments up for as long as possible to facilitate discussion, but will harvest comments from the document if necessary to prevent it from becoming unwieldy.
- Read the document (as [PDF](https://github.com/langeipk/MIAPPE-checklist/blob/v1.1-rfc/MIAPPE_v1.1_rfc1_proposal.pdf), or in Google docs), and email to miappe-feedback@ebi.ac.uk
- Read the document, and raise an issue on our public [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE-checklist/issues)
- Provide chances as [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

We would like to encourage feedback by the end of August 2018, in order that we can prepare a revised proposal in accordance with the comments (and take further feedback prior to eventual ratification by the MIAPPE steering committee). 
Please share this request with anyone who you know who might be interested in contributing. We request that individuals do not comment anonymously. All contributions will be discussed by the development team, and responded to in writing, and contributors will be credited on www.miappe.org.  All contributors will also be invited to participate in the writing of a paper to publicise the final standard.
Responses to comments will be prepared by the development team via remote discussion (email and meetings). Development of MIAPPE is an open process, so if you would like to do more than just comment, and to participate in these meetings, please let us know via miappe-feedback@ebi.ac.uk.
